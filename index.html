  <p>It's a <b>summer camp</b> for people of all ages, filled with laughter,
    singalongs, swimming in the lagoon, talent shows, and group meals in the dining hall.</p>

  <p>It's a <b>retreat</b>, with thought-provoking morning programs followed by small group
    discussions, and additional opportunities to explore social justice issues.</p>

  <p>It's an opportunity for <b>spiritual connection</b>, with worship services each evening.</p>

  <p>It's a chance to express <b>creativity</b> - explore music in choir, rock band and
    coffeehouse performances, learn a new visual art, dance, or tie-dye.</p>

  <p>It's a safe space for <b>personal growth</b>, from the profound to the silly.</p>

  <p>It's a time to enjoy <b>nature-walk</b> in the woods, watch the sunset, listen
    to the birds, and look for shells on the shore of Hood Canal.</p>

  <p>It's a <b>]multi-generational community</b> of people who find their happy place at Seabeck Conference Center.</p>

  <p><b>Eliot is all of these things and more!</b></p>
