### Program Description

During the morning program, Guy Nelson will take the group through a transformative process by using a series of fun and powerful games and activities. You'll learn to change your language, behavior and thinking patterns to expand the way you see yourself and the world around you. Step out of a limiting, self-critical mindset into one of exploration and wonder where everything is possible. You'll discover your brilliant sense of humor and creativity, and learn to co-create art, stories and solutions with others. Oh, and you'll spend most of the time laughing heartily!

The program is open to everyone of all abilities and experiences. No special writing or performing skills are needed. Most importantly, the games and activities are non-competitive, so there is no failure, no judgment and no right or wrong.
