### Program Description

> The wise Rabbi known as the Bal Shem Tov said many years ago: “When the thread that holds heaven and earth together is broken, not even prayer can help, only a story can mend it.”

When the legendary storyteller Scheherazade saw her people torn asunder by grief and anger, she employed the use of countless stories over “a thousand and one nights” to heal the heart a wounded sultan gone mad and change the fate of her realm.

And as the cultural anthropologist Angeles Arrien has noted, “many indigenous cultures agree that storytelling is an antidote to a primary cause for illness and disease: ‘loss of meaning.’”

In challenging times of radical change when collective despair and grief can seem to overwhelm the spirit, deaden the soul and impair vision, the ancient medicines of story, poem, song and ritual are essential in healing and renewal. As well as reweaving the torn fabric of communal life, these age-old practices can remind us of the unique medicine we each carry and inspire us to come forward with the healing and blessing that we alone can bestow to the world.

Celtic lore holds: “Every wound makes its own medicine and every cut carries its own cure.” During our week together we will employ a variety of stories, songs, poems and rituals to recall threads of meaning, feeling, healing and renewal that are inspired by such difficult times. We will consider what ‘medicine of healing’ is made by and required of us in these days.  Through dialogue and storytelling we will see how the old myths and legends can remind us of our own stories and recall to us the nature of our own journeys of healing and renewal.
