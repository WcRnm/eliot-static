Program Description: Guy has led this activity session at July Eliot 2024, and at Seabeck Retreats for several organizations, and people rave about the experience. The games are playful, fun and non-competitive. They quickly build a deep connection between participants and tap into everyone's innate creativity and imagination. As the sessions evolve, participants explore storytelling and how much we can learn from telling our own stories and listening to those of others. For many it is a transformational experience as we reflect on our habits of thinking, speaking and creating, then expand them beyond our self-defined limits.  Guy believes Creative Play can transform groups and individuals and is a deeply spiritual practice that teaches us to be present, open, compassionate and imaginative in all aspects of our lives. Come see how we can learn it and apply it!  No experience necessary, all ages teen to seniors. Wear comfortable clothing. No props needed, though a notebook may help you remember key ideas.
