### Program Description

Do you enjoy playing tabletop games like Dungeons and Dragons, but are tired of using bare plastic figurines? Are you a sculptor wanting to add color and depth to your creations? In this workshop, weâ€™ll learn how to use acrylic paints to breathe life into three-dimensional miniatures, starting with the basic steps to paint your first miniature, and moving up to skills and techniques used by the masters of realist painting. This is a workshop for everyone, from beginners who have never touched a paintbrush, to traditional painters looking to transfer their skills to the third dimension, or even experienced modelmakers and miniature painters who want to hone their craft.
