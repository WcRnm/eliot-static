###  Program Description

This workshop experience will introduce students to the unique art form known as waxed powder painting. Waxed powder painting involves directly applying powdered pigments to a surface (usually paper) and finishing the work with various wax media.The workshop will cover the mixing, handling, and application of powder pigment, the benefits of various paper types, stencil cutting, and the manufacture and application strategies of both cold and encaustic wax media.

Along the way, participants will learn an approach to abstraction and art making that centers presence and self transcendence. Various nature and poetry exercises will help participants craft a practice of encounter and expression that allows them to access their whole being as a means to making art. We will learn about an approach I call “the alphabet of everything.” This included witnessing and borrowing elements from the natural world as an alphabet with which to express one’s self…or lack of self.
