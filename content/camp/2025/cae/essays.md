## Workshop Description

”I am not going to talk about religious beliefs but about matters so obvious that it has gone out of style to mention them. I believe in my neighbors.”

Those words are from the most popular essay of the thousands written for the radio program, “This I Believe,” hosted by journalist Edward R. Murrow in the early 1950s. The essay was called “Our Noble, Essential Decency." It was by the science fiction writer, Robert A. Heinlein. The show debuted in an era of tremendous upheaval and paranoia. Murrow tried to cut through the fog of fear by encouraging both famous and everyday people to write short essays about their own personal motivation and values in life and then read them on the air. “This I Believe” stressed individual belief rather than religious dogma, and it became a huge cultural phenomenon.

More recently, National Public Radio offered a program based on the same principles that Murrow had championed: inviting people to write short, heartfelt essays about their beliefs. In the early 2000’s, I offered a class - first in my local church and then internationally, online - based on the guidelines provided by NPR. Participants wrote amazing, moving pieces, grounded in their sincerest beliefs and most meaningful life experiences.

I believe our fractured, confusing era is ripe for another round of such essays!

In these fun and intense workshops, campers will be encouraged to delve deeply within to explore their own most cherished beliefs. We'll read some of the classic essays from the original "This I Believe." We'll apply Hollywood techniques to add color and music to our words, and to grab and hold the reader's attention. We'll work together in duos and small groups to polish our essays. We will share encouragement but not critiques. Most of all, we will encounter powerful surprises - in our own hearts and in those of our neighbors. If you’d like to start writing a sermon, a memoir or a novel, or simply want to reflect with others on the central motivating forces of your life, this might be just the spark you need.
