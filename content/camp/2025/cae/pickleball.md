### Workshop Description

Pickleball is a fast growing sport that is addictive, fun, and quick to learn. If you spend 4 mornings at Creative Arts Eliot learning the basics, you will know how to dink, smash, serve, and volley. You'll figure out how to keep score and what the kitchen is all about. As the days go by, we'll get into strategy for more successful games. (In the unlikely case that the weather is bad, there's always YouTube videos to learn from.)

This workshop is intended for novice pickleball players. Even if you've never played a racquet sport before, you can have fun your first time out on the court. If you are a tennis, badminton, or racquetball player, all the better! Pickleball is usually played as a doubles game, and the court is small, so people of all ages can play and have fun.
