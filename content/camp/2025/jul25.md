### Program Description

Explorations in community music, creativity and well-being. Can singing, dancing and playing together make us healthier individuals contributing to a healthier society?

### Bio

Lea Morris was born in Washington, DC to a father who toured the world playing trumpet in a funk band and a mother who dreamed of opera. Lea began singing in the Baptist church as soon as she could speak. In high school, she taught herself acoustic guitar by writing songs and then embarked on an exchange year in Germany. Lea and her compositions have earned many accolades, including Best Vocalist, Best Recording, and Songwriter of the Year.

Having shared the stage with luminaries including Odetta and Mavis Staples, Lea is returning to her roots with multi-layered chants and a community singing project in Braunschweig, Germany, where she currently resides.

Here is a video of Lea leading a workshop:

## Additional Activities

Morning program is just one aspect of July Eliot!

Other activities include: sports, swimming in the lagoon, boating, puzzles, board games, group games, art projects, writing activities, worship, social justice discussions, hikes in the woods, and more.

One of the highlights of July is music: singalongs on the Inn Porch, songs and jokes at Firelight, coffee house, a concert and talent show. Rock band practice every day leads up to a high energy dance on the last night.
