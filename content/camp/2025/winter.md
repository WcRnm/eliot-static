# Winter Eliot 2025: "Stick Pounding" with Melanie DeMore

Sunday, December 28, 2025 from 02:30 PM to Thursday, January 01, 2026 to 11:45 AM

## Stick Pounding

### Program Description:

Learn the basics of Gullah Stick Pounding. We will create a foot stomping, hand-clapping rhythmic community and combine it with singing spirituals and songs of protest and peace. Participants will learn about Gullah/Geechee culture through its dynamic music and rhythmic heart.   We will create and affirm our common agreed upon language through the making of sticks and sharing our stories and those of our ancestors.We will, as a community, turn the whole place into a living, breathing drum.

## Additional Activities

Morning program is just one aspect of Winter Eliot!

Other activities include: choir, singalongs, puzzles, board games, group games, art projects, writing activities, worship, hikes in the woods, and more.

The final evening is New Year's Eve, which includes a worship service where we write what we want to release and/or what we are hoping for in the coming year, place it on a raft that we set aflame, then sail out onto the lagoon. Then we ring in the New Year with a dance and a dessert buffet!
