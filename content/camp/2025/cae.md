## Creative Arts Eliot 2025 Workshops

### Watercolor Nature Journaling
Elizabeth Higgins

Workshop Description: Slow down to notice, reflect and record your thoughts and observations in a nature journal.  In this relaxing workshop, no previous skills are necessary to learn a variety of simple and fun creative techniques for capturing and celebrating nature in a sketchbook.  Participants will use pencils, pens, watercolors and other materials to draw, paint and write in a way that is joyful and process-oriented.  Each day will offer new techniques, prompts and inspiration for students to use in their own personal nature journal.

Biography:  Elizabeth Higgins is an Oregon artist and arts instructor who develops and teaches watercolor classes and nature connection workshops that connect people to nature, mindfulness and creativity.  As a teacher, she encourages others to have fun creating, to be open to possibilities, and to be confident in one’s own creative expression, free from judgment of thoughts of what makes art “good” or “right.”  Elizabeth believes in the importance of nature and creativity to positive mental well-being, and has completed training in Nature Therapy practices to augment her teachings.  She is a juried member of Watercolor Society of Oregon and has won local awards for her vibrant, colorful watercolor paintings.  Learn more about Elizabeth at www.elizabethmhiggins.com

## This I Believe: Exploring & Expressing Our Heartfelt Beliefs Through Short Essays
Amanda Aikman

Workshop Description: ”I am not going to talk about religious beliefs but about matters so obvious that it has gone out of style to mention them. I believe in my neighbors.”

Those words are from the most popular essay of the thousands written for the radio program, “This I Believe,” hosted by journalist Edward R. Murrow in the early 1950s. The essay was called “Our Noble, Essential Decency." It was by the science fiction writer, Robert A. Heinlein. The show debuted in an era of tremendous upheaval and paranoia. Murrow tried to cut through the fog of fear by encouraging both famous and everyday people to write short essays about their own personal motivation and values in life and then read them on the air. “This I Believe” stressed individual belief rather than religious dogma, and it became a huge cultural phenomenon.

More recently, National Public Radio offered a program based on the same principles that Murrow had championed: inviting people to write short, heartfelt essays about their beliefs. In the early 2000’s, I offered a class - first in my local church and then internationally, online - based on the guidelines provided by NPR. Participants wrote amazing, moving pieces, grounded in their sincerest beliefs and most meaningful life experiences.

I believe our fractured, confusing era is ripe for another round of such essays!

In these fun and intense workshops, campers will be encouraged to delve deeply within to explore their own most cherished beliefs. We'll read some of the classic essays from the original "This I Believe." We'll apply Hollywood techniques to add color and music to our words, and to grab and hold the reader's attention. We'll work together in duos and small groups to polish our essays. We will share encouragement but not critiques. Most of all, we will encounter powerful surprises - in our own hearts and in those of our neighbors. If you’d like to start writing a sermon, a memoir or a novel, or simply want to reflect with others on the central motivating forces of your life, this might be just the spark you need.

Biography: The Rev. Amanda Aikman retired in 2016-ish after about 25 years as a parish and community minister in the PNW. Back in the glorious days when UU organizations sponsored national sermon contests, she won an unprecedented 12 of them. She is the author of a self-help book, Full-Spectrum Joyfulness (2010), and a racy lesbian romance, Miss Lister's Guest House (2023), as well as about 15 plays that have been produced on various stages in Washington and New York. Amanda has been involved with Eliot camps as a theme presenter and chaplain. She lives with her spousal unit, Nancy, in Everett.

## Waxed Powder Painting
Corey Pressman

Program Description: This workshop experience will introduce students to the unique art form known as waxed powder painting. Waxed powder painting involves directly applying powdered pigments to a surface (usually paper) and finishing the work with various wax media.The workshop will cover the mixing, handling, and application of powder pigment, the benefits of various paper types, stencil cutting, and the manufacture and application strategies of both cold and encaustic wax media.

Along the way, participants will learn an approach to abstraction and art making that centers presence and self transcendence. Various nature and poetry exercises will help participants craft a practice of encounter and expression that allows them to access their whole being as a means to making art. We will learn about an approach I call “the alphabet of everything.” This included witnessing and borrowing elements from the natural world as an alphabet with which to express one’s self…or lack of self.

Biography:  Corey S. Pressman is an artist, writer, and teacher living in the Pacific Northwest. His art is shown around the country and has won several awards. Corey regularly teaches workshops propagating his approach to art and the method of waxed powder painting. He has published academic works as well as short stories and poetry. Corey is a member/owner of Portland’s Blackfish Gallery and works as a creativity coach and as an instructor in the Integrative Health and Wellness program at the University of Portland.

In addition, forms that lend themselves to embellishment will be shared.  Fabric choices can include cotton, wool, silk and linen.  Scraps are welcome additions to the crazy quilt genera. Embroidery stitches that are easy to use will be demonstrated and/or reviewed. Beginners, intermediate and advanced stitchers are all welcome and will find a challenge to enjoy.

She is an experienced teacher and quilt judge and served on the Seabeck Quilt Team to curate the hangings in New Pines.

## Pickleball
Karen Stratton

Workshop Description: Pickleball is a fast growing sport that is addictive, fun, and quick to learn. If you spend 4 mornings at Creative Arts Eliot learning the basics, you will know how to dink, smash, serve, and volley. You'll figure out how to keep score and what the kitchen is all about. As the days go by, we'll get into strategy for more successful games. (In the unlikely case that the weather is bad, there's always YouTube videos to learn from.)

This workshop is intended for novice pickleball players. Even if you've never played a racquet sport before, you can have fun your first time out on the court. If you are a tennis, badminton, or racquetball player, all the better! Pickleball is usually played as a doubles game, and the court is small, so people of all ages can play and have fun.

People have described her play as "cerebral", to which she replies, "I'm not the fastest or the hardest hitting, but I play smart. You can too."

## Kids at CAE

Children at least 11 years old are welcome to participate in the workshops.

Children under 11:

    may partipate in a workshop, if the workshop presenter, child, and parent are in agreement! If your kid wants to be in a workshop, please email the registrar to find out if this will be ok. registrar@eliotinstitute.org
    may be able to attend a children's progam in the morning. CAE tends to attract an older crowd, so we don't always have a children's program for younger kids. In order to make sure we have time to recruit staff, we ask that kids under 11 years old are signed up at least 6 weeks prior to camp. (For 2025, that's June 28th.) Children CAN register after this point, but we may not be able to accomodate them in a children's program and parents will be responsible for their supervision. If you've got questions about the CAE children's program, or the deadline has passed, please email the registrar at registrar@eliotinstitute.org
