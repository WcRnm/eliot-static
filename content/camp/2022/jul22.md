### Program Description

How do we build Unitarian Universalism into the multicultural faith we want it to be?  A crucial step is to examine the ways that white supremacy shapes our current religious culture.  Culture includes the ways that we communicate, make decisions, define reality, trust and support leaders, and many other factors.  This week will allow participants to reflect on how our own enculturation in the white supremacies of the US and Canada shape us, as well examining how our own congregations could benefit from a strategic reevaluation and reimagination, taking seriously the ways that white supremacy influences all of our structures.

Join us for a time of reconnection and healing with a priority on creating a space which is joyful and loving for all campers.
