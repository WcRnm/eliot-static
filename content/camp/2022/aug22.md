### Program Description

Join us for an exploration about what music can teach us about being in harmony, moving in rhythm, and making a difference.

- Music is about call and response: Lifting your voice and answering back in dialogue
- Music is about practicing: Learning new skills, trying the hard things, teaching each other how to do the impossible
- Music is about community and covenant: Listening deeply and moving together
- Music is about collective action: Each person plays their role to create something greater than the sum of their parts.

Through song and rhythm, story and reflection, we'll explore what a radically inclusive, spiritually alive, and justice-centered movement of Unitarian Universalism looks like.
