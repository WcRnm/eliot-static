### Program Description:

*Dynamic Balance*:  Understanding our being and developing skillful equilibrium of body, mind and soul

*Harmony*:  Joy and rhythm that emanates from practicing dynamic balance in relationship with all creation

Ruth and Deanna co-create containers of welcome and witness that invites participants to connect and reconnect to ways of ourselves so we can be in more authentic relationships and to find ways of cooling and calming our spirits. WE begin with acknowledging that the world around us feels, at the very least, chaotic and that we are often more in touch  with our anxiety, frustration and fear than with a sense of harmony.  The fundamentals of this workshop invite us into our inner wisdom to find what joy and peace we innately have access to, in the context of a gathered community of beloveds. Together we will practice smithing our souls with faithful, liberatory practices.  This will be a holistic offering engaging every bit of our beings.

Smithing our Souls is a term that came to Ruth after Hurricane Katrina and has emerged in our collaboration as a way to name the unnamable, the processes through which the universe and energies around us are constantly shaping us into the enlightened beings we are called to be.  The smithing of our souls can feel very harsh - like the hammering of a blacksmith’s tools - or as light and gentle as a butterfly landing on your shoulder.  Often both and so many feelings in between.  With intention and care, we will join in collective spiritual practices of dynamic balance and harmony in the midst of struggle and transformation.

The program is open to everyone of all abilities and experiences. Soul Smithing is for everyone!
