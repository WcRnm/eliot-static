## Registration Details

Campers are placed in workshops in the order they register, so, don't delay! Go to our homepage and click on the Big Blue Button to register! We will send you a separate workshop selection form later on.

Campers are placed in workshops in the order they register, so, don't delay! Go to our homepage and click on the Big Blue Button to register for Creative Arts Eliot!

## Kids at CAE

Children at least 11 years old are welcome to participate in the workshops.

Children under 11:

may partipate in a workshop, if the workshop presenter, child, and parent are in agreement! If your kid wants to be in a workshop, please email the registrar to find out if this will be ok. registrar@eliotinstitute.org
may be able to attend a children's progam in the morning. CAE tends to attract an older crowd, so we don't always have a children's program for younger kids. In order to make sure we have time to recruit staff, we ask that kids under 11 years old are signed up at least 6 weeks prior to camp. (For 2025, that's June 28th.) Children CAN register after this point, but we may not be able to accomodate them in a children's program and parents will be responsible for their supervision. If you've got questions about the CAE children's program, or the deadline has passed, please email the registrar at registrar@eliotinstitute.org

## Additional Activities

The workshops take place in the mornings. Some workshops offer optional drop-in studios in the afternoon to continue working independently on your project.

But workshops aren't all that happens at Creative Arts Eliot!

Other activities include: singalongs or instrument jam sessions, pickleball, boating or swimming, worship, salmon bake on the beach, board games, additional arts workshops, a literary salon, and a talent show.

The final morning is the Extravaganza when you have a chance to see what all the campers were working on in the other workshops and get excited to come back again next year and try out another workshop!
