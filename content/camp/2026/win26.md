### Program Description:

To be announced.

### Additional Activities

Morning program is just one aspect of Winter Eliot!

Other activities include: choir, singalongs, puzzles, board games, group games, art projects, writing activities, worship, hikes in the woods, and more.

The final evening is New Year's Eve, which includes a worship service where we write what we want to release and/or what we are hoping for in the coming year, place it on a raft that we set aflame, then sail out onto the lagoon. Then we ring in the New Year with a dance and a dessert buffet!
