# July Eliot 2026

<div id="camp-card"></div>

### Program Description

Unitarian Universalism teaches that all of who you are belongs, all of who you are matters, all of who you are is worthy. In this faith, diversity is sacred and gender and sexuality are sources of wholeness and authenticity. Yet we receive far too many messages every day to the contrary. The pressure to conform and perpetuate stereotypes and norms is immense, and a coordinated anti-trans political movement has swept the country in recent years, spreading disinformation and dehumanization.

These seven days will be a time to let your light shine and celebrate the diversity of gender in our world and in those around you. For those burdened by gender-based oppression, let the load down for a week, find joy and ease, and soak up the love and freedom of camp. For those who haven’t given much thought to gender diversity, consider this an invitation to immerse yourself in what it means to be a radically welcoming, heart-transforming community of people of all identities, ages, experiences, and backgrounds.

Daily programming will engage with what trans and nonbinary Unitarian Universalism looks like and the gifts such a perspective offers everyone, how oppressive gender norms and roles limit us all, and how creating more room for the fullness of gender and sexuality in our lives, our congregations, and our larger world is essential in the fight against rising fascism and Christian nationalism.

No matter what your identities are, you won’t want to miss this camp! Trans, nonbinary, intersex, queer, and questioning folks and family members of LGBTQ people are particularly strongly encouraged to attend.

Zr. Alex Kapitan (ze/per) is a community minister, educator, editor, consultant, and activist. A queer and nonbinary lifelong Unitarian Universalist, ze does interfaith LGBTQ work and supports congregations in becoming places of radical welcome for all. Alex presented a version of this same program at the 2024 August Eliot camp and it was highly acclaimed.

Alex is the co-founder of the Transforming Hearts Collective, an organizing ministry that both supports spaces for LGBTQ people to access resilience, healing, and spirituality and resources faith communities and other groups for the work of radical welcome and culture shift. As part of that work ze co-created the program Trans Inclusion in Congregations for UU congregations, which has been engaged with by hundreds of congregations across the continent. Alex is also the founder of Radical Copyeditor, an anti-oppressive language project that helps people understand, among many other things, why using “they” singularly is a revolutionary and essential act.

Alex worked for many years at the UUA’s national office supporting Welcoming Congregation, anti-racism, and social justice projects, and is also a past steering committee member for TRUUsT, the organization of trans UU religious professionals. Ze lives in western Massachusetts with per partner Teo Drake and a menagerie of furry and feathered friends.

### Additional Activities

Morning program is just one aspect of July Eliot!

Other activities include: sports, swimming in the lagoon, boating, puzzles, board games, group games, art projects, writing activities, worship, social justice discussions, hikes in the woods, and more.

One of the highlights of July is music: singalongs on the Inn Porch, songs and jokes at Firelight, coffee house, a concert and talent show. Rock band practice every day leads up to a high energy dance on the last night.
