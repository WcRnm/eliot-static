### Program Description:

Climate change, COVID-19, armed conflicts - the collective  impact of these global issues impacts our own feelings of well-being and those of the people we love. With problems deemed more newsworthy than solutions, we are awash in a 24/7 newscycle that reinforces the myth that it is already too late or that issues are too big or too broken to change.  In this multi-day workshop, we’ll engage in a series of practices to honor our feelings and to empower ourselves by challenging the narrative of fatalistic doomism and shifting toward evidence-based hope.

This workshop is open to youth and adults and will involve opportunities to engage through conversation, art and time spent outdoors in nature.
