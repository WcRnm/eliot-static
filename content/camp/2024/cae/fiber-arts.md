### Program Description

Wool is one of the oldest materials used by humans. It is incredibly easy to sew through and felted wool is the perfect medium for using decorative stitches and creating gifts for beloveds. This workshop will focus on learning and practicing embroidery with Perle cotton and other threads on felted wool. Other embellishments may be added as desired. Each participant will be able to work on a sampler of stitches and create one or more projects of the participants choice. All of the work will be done by hand. Experience with simple embroidery technique is a plus. Experience with basic sewing skills is highly recommended. Students will be expanding their lexicon of stitches from the most basic running stitch to more complex stitches that include wrapped and other wonderful stitches that can be combined for graphic impact. A supply list and introductory letter will be sent as soon as registrations are confirmed.
