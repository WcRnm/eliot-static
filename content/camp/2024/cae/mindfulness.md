### Program Description

Mindfulness has been described as a superpower because it trains our minds to help our brains to help our minds. Yikes!  In this workshop, we’ll untangle the message here and use mindfulness meditations and techniques to cultivate the mental states that support our creativity and help us release mental rigidity and resistance, whether we’re newcomers or veteran artists. Each day will include discussions, group activities and guided meditations on positive mental traits, such as awe, non-judgment, integration, gratitude and compassion, and their specific relevance to creativity.  Expect to feel relaxed, inspired and connected—a willing spirit and writing notebook or sketchbook are all you’ll need.  Samples of your visual or literary art, or work in progress, are  welcome—though not required—so that we may include them in group activities.  Time and space will also be available for those who’d like to pursue individual projects outside of workshop hours.
