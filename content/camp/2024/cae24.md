Registration Details

## Workshops

<div id="workshop-area"></div>

## Kids at CAE

Children at least 11 years old are welcome to participate in the workshops.

Children under 11:

    may partipate in a workshop, if the workshop presenter, child, and parent are in agreement! If your kid wants to be in a workshop, please email the registrar to find out if this will be ok. registrar@eliotinstitute.org
    may be able to attend a children's progam in the morning. CAE tends to attract an older crowd, so we don't always have a children's program for younger kids. In order to make sure we have time to recruit staff, we ask that kids under 11 years old are signed up at least 6 weeks prior to camp. (For 2025, that's June 28th.) Children CAN register after this point, but we may not be able to accomodate them in a children's program and parents will be responsible for their supervision. If you've got questions about the CAE children's program, or the deadline has passed, please email the registrar at registrar@eliotinstitute.org

## Additional Activities

The workshops take place in the mornings. Some workshops offer optional drop-in studios in the afternoon to continue working independently on your project.

But workshops aren't all that happens at Creative Arts Eliot!

Other activities include: singalongs or instrument jam sessions, pickleball, boating or swimming, worship, salmon bake on the beach, board games, additional arts workshops, a literary salon, and a talent show.

The final morning is the Extravaganza when you have a chance to see what all the campers were working on in the other workshops and get excited to come back again next year and try out another workshop!
