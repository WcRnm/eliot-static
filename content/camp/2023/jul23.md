### Program Description:
How does coming together support our purpose as Unitarian Universalists; and how does art fuel this purpose? “Great things are done by a series of small things brought together.” - Vincent Van Gogh. This in an invitation to engage in the exploration and creation of the many small things that make a beautiful life and community. You don’t have to be an artist to engage in this program, you just have to like things and say what is beautiful to you. To get you started, watch this video by Alain de Botton
