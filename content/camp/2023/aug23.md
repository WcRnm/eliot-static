### Program Description:

Being confronted by the intensity and uncertainty that change brings is a real part of living in the world and a necessary aspect of growing in our Unitarian Universalism. How can we stay present with care and without doing harm to ourselves or others in the process? What is mindfulness in the context of radical welcome and culture shift? How does an embodied approach move us from intensity and uncertainty to clarity and call? Join Rev. Mykal as we consider these questions together at the water’s edge.

Bring your whole self to our time together. Also, consider bringing items (i.e., a picture or a drum), words, songs, and practices that ground you.
