### Program Description

Many of us are struggling amidst the overwhelming onslaught of urgent issues such as climate change, COVID 19 and species extinctions that are happening at a global scale. In this program, Elin Kelsey draws on timely evidence from a plethora of sources including leading science journals, the financial pages, and mindfulness and palliative care practices to show why hope, and not fear and shame enable us to remain resilient and engage more effectively when the going gets tough. She'll show us how and why it's so essential to embrace a solutions-orientation and how to move beyond the incessant predictions of a bleak future that bombards us via the Twenty-four-hour news cycle, alerts on personal mobile devices and social media.  We'll head outside together and explore the agency and resilience that exists within the 8.7 million other species with which we share the planet, and benefit from the mental and emotional well-being of time spent outdoors.

The program is open to everyone of all abilities and experiences. No special writing or performing skills are needed.
