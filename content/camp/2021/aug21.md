### Program Description

We live in turbulent times and we are all navigating the same choppy waters. Knowing we cannot go back from where we came, and that we have not reached a new land, we need to learn the skills to survive and thrive the journey. We will spend the week exploring the land we left, why we could not stay, where we think we might want to be, and how we will get there together. The journey is not easy, and we will take many detours, but until we all get there can anyone of us arrive.
