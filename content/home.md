It's a <b>summer camp</b> for people of all ages, filled with laughter, 
singalongs, swimming in the lagoon, talent shows, and group meals in the dining hall.

It's a <b>retreat</b>, with thought-provoking morning programs followed by small group 
discussions, and additional opportunities to explore social justice issues.

It's an opportunity for <b>spiritual connection</b>, with worship services each evening.

It's a chance to express <b>creativity</b> - explore music in choir, rock band and 
coffeehouse performances, learn a new visual art, dance, or tie-dye.

It's a safe space for <b>personal growth</b>, from the profound to the silly.

It's a time to enjoy <b>nature-walk</b> in the woods, watch the sunset, listen 
to the birds, and look for shells on the shore of Hood Canal.

It's a <b>]multi-generational community</b> of people who find their happy place at Seabeck Conference Center.

<b>Eliot is all of these things and more!</b>
