## Meals at Eliot

Most people love meals at Seabeck, which are served  in the dining room. No need to cook or clean up!

Some meals (typically breakfast and lunch) are served from a buffet line, where you gather your food, then take it to a table indoors or outdoors. (If you need assistance with carrying items, just ask anyone!) Other meals (typically dinner) are served family style at your table.

When requested before camp starts, the Seabeck kitchen can provide four alternatives to the regular, omnivorous menu: 1) vegetarian, 2) vegan, 3) no dairy, and 4) no gluten. Make your requests through the Eliot Registar. At check-in you will receive a “special diet” card which your server will ask for at each meal. It is important not to eat special meals prepared for others. If you decide partway through camp that you no longer need the accommodation, let the registrar know. 

A refrigerator in the dining room area is available for those who bring food for special diets or to accommodate children’s preferences. 

More dining details are available on the Seabeck website.
