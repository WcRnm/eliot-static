# Survival Guide

This page contains more detail to help you plan for camp: learn about accessibility, amenities, communications between camp and outside camp, and info on medical care.

## Accessibility Notes

### Vision 

A paper newsletter is distributed each day, which contains important information about camp. If you would like an electronic version that is compatible with a screen reader, let the newsletter editor know. We have a blind Elioteer who has taught us about the need to introduce ourselves verbally before speaking, and when there is an event that is very dependent on visuals (for example a slide show of photographs), other campers have sat next to them to verbally describe what is shown. If you would benefit from similar support, let the Deans know.

Trained service animals are allowed at Seabeck. Pets are not allowed, nor are emotional support animals.

### Hearing

We use microphones / amplified sound for most major events (such as morning program, lunchtime announcements, and evening events). If you are having difficulties hearing, don't hesitate to talk with the AV volunteers and they can help to troubleshoot ways to make things more audible for you. There is assisted listening equipment in the meeting house. We are working to train AV volunteers in its use. For morning small groups: when you complete the form to sign up, you may request an indoor group as that will be easier to hear than an outdoor group.

### Neurodiversity

We have had many neurodiverse folks attend camp. Things can get loud at times, so folks with auditory sensitivities may find headphones or earplugs a helpful tool to pack. Some folks at camp love to give and receive hugs, but if you prefer not to be touched, people are generally quite good about asking for consent and/or understanding when you share that you prefer not to be touched. For oral sensitivities: there are special diet options, and at all meals, there are many different options that might accommodate your preferences. You may also bring some preferred foods from home and store it in your car, or in a refrigerator in the dining hall. (Note that fridge space is shared and may be quite limited.)

In the morning program for children and youth, most staff will be familiar with neurodiversity and know some accommodations that might help. But when you fill out your child's medical form prior to camp, we encourage you to share any tips that would help your child feel included and supported at camp.

### Medical Devices

All rooms have electricity and can accommodate things like CPAPs. There are available refrigerators if you have medication that needs to be kept cold.

### Hidden Disabilities

If you have a hidden disability, and would like to signal to others that you might need a little extra help, or just more time, you may choose to signal that by wearing a sunflower symbol.

### Mobility

Seabeck has a large campus (map) with many buildings. For navigating between buildings, most of the paths are paved. (The fire pit and swim beach can only be accessed via dirt paths.) There are moderate hills on several paths, but they are navigable with a scooter or with assistance pushing a wheelchair. We also have a golf cart at every camp so if you need a ride, all you need do is text our volunteer to come and fetch you to take you where you need to go. Seabeck also has an electric wheelchair you can arrange to borrow.

For meetings and activities - the following buildings are wheelchair accessible: the Inn lobby and Dining Hall, Juniper, Pines, the lower floor of the meeting house, Rhododendron, lower Colman, the A Frame Lounge, small group meeting areas in: Huckleberry, Salal, Spruce, Maples. Firs does not have stairs, but is likely not wheelchair accessible due to a small turning radius in the entry way. These buildings require climbing a few stairs: Chapel, lower Reeser. Although Upper Colman has a ramp, it is somewhat challenging to navigate.

The following spaces require climbing a full flight of stairs: Upper Meeting House, upper Reeser. If you see an activity scheduled there that you would like to attend, ask the Volunteer Coordinator to move it to another space.

For lodging: on your registration form, you will be able to mark whether you need an ADA accessible room, ground floor with level entry, ground floor with some steps OK, or need to be close to a bathroom. Learn more about housing options on the Seabeck site. Rooms with a private bath do cost more than those with a shared bath. If you have a physical need which requires a private bathroom but the cost is prohibitive, you are encouraged to apply for a scholarship to make up the difference in cost.

If you have any additional questions about accessibility and accommodations, please contact the Eliot registrar, and she will help you find answers and solutions for how we can support your full participation in camp.

## Attending with Children 3 and under

We offer information here that will help you think about your needs, and what you may or may not choose to pack. The first aid team does not stock medicines (like children's Tylenol) or bulb syringes, but they have plenty of bandaids and such. Seabeck does not provide cribs or pack and plays. Many, but not all, bathrooms have stepstools to support hand-washing. There are not changing tables in the bathrooms. Housing facilities have showers, not bathtubs. There are a few high chairs for use in the dining room, on a first come, first served basis. 

There is a refrigerator in the dining room (only accessible during meals), one in Colman, one in Pines, and small ones in Spruce and Juniper. These are available for storage of breastmilk, and limited storage of other items. (They are shared by all 250 campers, so please limit your use to the bare essentials, and please clearly label all items.) The small fridge in Juniper is not available if social hour is being held in Juniper. There are microwaves in Spruce, Pines, and Juniper.

For camps where food is served in buffet lines, families with children under 3 should be able to cut into line - ask the accessibility coordinator or deans to share this expectation at orientation and/or in newsletter announcements. 

The lagoon area is muddy, and the beach is rocky, so having shoes a child can wear in water is helpful for enjoying wading and swimming. 

There are laundry machines in Pines, and in a small laundry building near Huckleberry. No detergent is provided. These are a shared resource and may not be available - you are welcome to create a sign-up sheet and post it there to facilitate planning.

We do attempt to house families with young kids in the same building to make it easier for you to connect with and support each other (and not feel as worried if your kid is crying in the middle of the night). Feel free to add a request for this to your registration.

## Communication at Camp

Most cellular phones work here, though depending on your service provider, coverage can be spotty. There are phones in the Inn lobby and outside the Pines lounge for local calls and calling card calls.  Free wireless internet access is available throughout  the conference center grounds. The wifi is generally sufficient for tasks like checking email. If you need to take a zoom call for work or have a Telehealth appointment, this can be done from most places on campus, but sometimes you may have to move around to find a good signal. Do not count on being able to stream movies while lying in your bed.

Mail or packages can be sent to the Seabeck office, if essential. Postage may be purchased at the Seabeck Conference Center office. Outgoing mail is picked up from the office at 4 p.m. The Seabeck office is staffed 24/7. The office can be reached at (360) 830-5010.

## Emergencies and First Aid

In case of emergency, call 911 and then notify the Seabeck office in person or phone 360-830-5010. 

First Aid supplies are available in the Inn Lobby, children's program areas, and on the swim dock (during summer). Fellow campers who have volunteered for First Aid assistance will be identified at the all-camp orientation on the first day. During summer swim times, a staff member at the lagoon usually has an air horn and 911 cell phone for emergency use. For additional assistance, ask an Eliot staff member.
