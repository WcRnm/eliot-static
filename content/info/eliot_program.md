Mornings are the most structured part of Eliot. After breakfast there is an all-camp ingathering with a short worship and music program for all ages.

After the ingathering, children and youth go to their programs. (Learn more.)

## Morning Program (July, August, Winter)

Adults can attend daily talks by the theme speaker. (Click on the camp links in the sidebar or at the bottom of each mobile page to learn more about this yearâ€™s speakers.)

The presentation is followed by Discussion Groups. If you choose, you can be assigned to a small group, which offers a chance to explore the program themes in more depth. A group facilitator will help direct the discussion. These groups are a great opportunity to open up and really get to know others in our community. In order to encourage a broad, inclusive experience for all, Eliot Institute strives for breadth and balance in our small groupings. We arrange small groups so that we achieve a gender, age and geographical spread, as well as placing people outside of family and congregational groupings as much as possible. This helps us to form new connections.

## Workshops (Creative Arts Eliot)

The morning consists of workshops such as printing, singing, drumming, sculpture, improv, dance, writing, etc. Each camper will select one workshop to participate in.  Workshops meet each morning, and there may be afternoon "open studios" for campers to see what's happening in other workshops.  A children's program is provided for campers younger than age 11. (If they register at least six weeks in advance.)

## Afternoon

You choose how to spend your afternoon! After lunch you can rest, read, or spend quiet time in nature. You can play ultimate frisbee or pickleball, paddle a boat or swim (in summer). You can get involved in all kinds of creative, artistic ventures: choir, instrumental groups, art workshops, or tie dye. You can put jigsaw puzzles together, play board games, or join discussions about social justice. Afternoon activities are organized by volunteers. Please respond to the calls for volunteers. It's a great way to meet people and to help make camp a wonderful experience for all.

## Evening

Evenings include a worship service, and are filled with a variety of multigenerational activities. These might include game shows, a concert, talent show, dance and coffeehouse or other fun all-camp activities.
