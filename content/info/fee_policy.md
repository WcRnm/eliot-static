# Current Cancellation Policy

1. A $50 per camper deposit is required before a registration is complete and registrant(s) can be confirmed to camp or placed on a waitlist (if needed).  A financial assistance application may be submitted in lieu of a deposit.

2. During pandemic, we created a relaxed cancellation policy. Given all the uncertainties of life, e have decided to continue that until further notice. As long as a camper cancels before camp begins (as of 2pm on arrival day) all fees are fully refundable.

3. If a cancellation occurs after camp begins, 100% of the total fee is forfeited. If a camper is asked to leave camp for any reason, this also applies.
