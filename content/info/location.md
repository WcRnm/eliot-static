# Location of Camps

## Seabeck, Washington

Eliot Camps are held at the Seabeck Conference Center, located in the town of Seabeck, Washington, on Hood Canal. (A 60 mile drive from SeaTac airport.)

The Conference Center includes over 90 acres with housing, meeting areas, dining hall, woods, a lagoon, beach access on Hood Canal, the Cathedral in the Woods, trails, a swimming platform, tennis courts, volleyball, two children's playgrounds, ping pong, an outdoor fire circle with built-in seating, an outdoor amphitheater, and a craft center. 

The Meeting House, built in 1857, was once the Mess Hall for the mill and community center. Today it serves as an auditorium on the Conference Center grounds. The bell that once called the mill hands to meals now calls campers to meals and services. Many of the houses built by early pioneers have been converted into guest lodging.

Eliot Institute and other Unitarian Universalist groups are the most frequent users of the Seabeck Conference Center.
