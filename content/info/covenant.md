Elioteers who are part of UU congregations are likely already familiar with the concept of covenant—a promise we make to each other about how we want to be when we come together in community. 

# Eliot Covenant

We, the Eliot community, are committed to creating and maintaining a safe and supportive environment for all campers, volunteers, and the Eliot and Seabeck staff.

As we gather in an intentional, inclusive community, we promise to:

- Bring our best selves to Eliot.
- Build a vibrant, multicultural community where all feel welcomed.
- Volunteer and contribute to the community experience we jointly create.
- Create an environment that supports each person’s unique spiritual journey.

Because we affirm and promote the Unitarian Universalist values of kindness, compassion, and respect for one another and the Earth, we promise to:

- Consider the diverse perspectives and experiences that individuals bring to Eliot.
- Listen deeply to appreciate other people’s needs and points of view.
- Express our own emotions and differences with respect and compassion.
- Act with consideration for others and the community as a whole.
- Treat the grounds, buildings, plants, and wildlife with respect and minimize our impact.

Recognizing that making mistakes and engaging in conflict will happen and can contribute to individual and community growth, we promise to:

- Make an effort to resolve conflicts and repair relationships constructively and in a direct and caring manner.
- Seek and offer forgiveness.
- Ask for help and support from Eliot leadership, if needed.  

Together, we are and we make Eliot a loving community.
