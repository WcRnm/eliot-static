# Printable Flyers and Brochures

Are you willing to help us get word out about our fabulous camps? Here are some materials to help with that!

- [2025 Eliot Institute Camp Flyer](/content/pdf/form/2025_Eliot_Flyer.pdf)
- [Eliot flyer for DREs and parents](/content/pdf/form/DRE_Day_In_the_Life_For_Kids_at_Eliot_3.0.pdf)

We also have a **trifold brochure**, but it is designed to be printed at a commercial printer and won't look as nice if printed at home. Contact the [Eliot Registrar](mailto://registar@eliotinstitute.org) if you need copies to handout at your church or group.
