# Registration Fees

<aside>
New campers in 2025 get a $50 per person discount off listed fees!
</aside>

Registration fees for Eliot are all inclusive, covering: housing, all meals, the morning programs and other camp activities.

For each camp, the costs vary based on the program, the length of the camp (how many nights) and on which housing you choose. Accommodations range from historic shared-bath economy houses to new, deluxe rooms with private bathrooms. 

**You can find detailed descriptions of each lodging option at [Seabeck Conference Center Housing](https://www.seabeck.org/lodging)**.

Per person cost for one adult ranges from $565 – 960 for Winter Eliot depending on housing, from $685 – 1045 for Creative Arts, and $750 – 1260 for July and August Eliot. Costs for children are lower. See chart below for full details, and review the [Deposit / Cancellation Policy](?info=fee_policy).

[Financial assistance](?info=financial_assistance) is available, or [you can apply to be on staff](?info=volunteer). Most staff roles include a credit that will significantly reduce your registration fees.

In early June of 2024, the Seabeck Conference Center (SCC) was informed by the Washington State Department of Revenue (WA DOR) that we were no longer exempt from paying property taxes. Property taxes for SCC run at about 6-7%. An unfortunate result of this determination is that the state now also requires SCC to charge its guest group sales tax of approximately 10%. These taxes are now rolled into the rates for Winter Eliot 205 and the summer 2026 camps, and as a result costs for camp are significantly higher this year than last year. SSC is in the process of appealing these rulings, but it is highly unlikely that SCC will get a positive ruling. If SCC does get a positive response from the WA DOR, then SCC will pass the savings on to their guest groups, and in turn, Eliot will pass the savings on to our campers. **We know that this price increase may impact the ability of some of our campers to attend camp; please remember that Eliot has a scholarship fund, and we encourage you to request [financial assistance](?info=financial_assistance) if the cost of camp is a barrier to your attendance.**
