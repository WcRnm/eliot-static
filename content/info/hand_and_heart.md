# The Golden Hand and Heart Award

    At every Eliot camp
    there are those who have their moment in the sun,
    who have the opportunity to sparkle
    or have titles or roles
    or are noticed and applauded.

    And then there are those
    who quietly go about making things happen
    as if by wires or mirrors or magic,
    who just bring what they have to bring,
    give it unobtrusively,
    and stay to the sides of the
    room to make space.

    These hidden wonders need recognition
    and gratitude as well.

    In that spirit,
    The Eliot Board hereby awards
