# Be A Volunteer!

Are you interested in getting more involved at Eliot beyond just being a camper? We’d love to have your support!

## Camp Staff

Would you be willing to serve on staff at a camp you’re planning to attend? Jobs include everything from lifeguard or first aid coordinator to worship planning, from children’s staff to social hour host. Check out the [job descriptions](?info=camp_jobs).

Many roles come with credit that can be applied to reduce your costs of attending camp. All roles allow you to make a meaningful contribution. If you are interested, please complete this application: [Application for Camp Staff Jobs](https://eliotinstitute.wufoo.com/forms/p1g1gs6u0y5uwea/). Deans start choosing their staff up to one year before a camp begins.

## Committee Volunteers

Would you like to help keep the Eliot spark alive year-round and share your skills with us? We have several committees that all welcome volunteers. Some committees meet monthly, some only meet a few times a year, so you can have a big impact with a minimal commitment. Check out the [committee page](?info=committees) to learn more about your options, and contact the committee chair to learn more. (Ask the [Eliot registrar](mailto://registrar@eliotinstitute.org) for their contact information.) Or you might want to be considered for the [Eliot Board](?info=board).

For committees or the board, please [fill out this form](https://eliotinstitute.wufoo.com/forms/p1842lbt1252t9r/) to indicate your interest.

Thank you from the Eliot Board. We couldn't do it without you!
