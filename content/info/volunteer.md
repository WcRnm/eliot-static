# Be A Volunteer!

Are you interested in getting more involved at Eliot beyond just being a camper? We’d love to have your support! 

## Camp Staff

Would you be willing to serve on staff at a camp you’re planning to attend? Jobs include everything from lifeguard or first aid coordinator to worship planning, from children’s staff to social hour host. Check out the job descriptions. Many roles come with credit that can be applied to reduce your costs of attending camp. All roles allow you to make a meaningful contribution. If you are interested, please complete this application: Application for Camp Staff Jobs. Deans start choosing their staff up to one year before a camp begins. 

## Committee Volunteers

Would you like to help keep the Eliot spark alive year-round and share your skills with us? We have several committees that all welcome volunteers. Some committees meet monthly, some only meet a few times a year, so you can have a big impact with a minimal commitment. Check out the committee charters to learn more about your options, and contact the committee chair to learn more. (Ask the Eliot registrar for their contact information.) Or you might want to be considered for the Eliot Board.

For committees or the board, please fill out this form to indicate your interest.

Thank you from the Eliot Board. We couldn't do it without you!
