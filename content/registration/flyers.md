# Printable Flyers and Brochures

Are you willing to help us get word out about our fabulous camps? Here are some materials to help with that!

- Click Here To Download the 2025 Eliot Institute Camp Flyer to print at home

- Click here to download the Eliot flyer for DREs and Parents to print at home

We also have a **trifold brochure**, but it is designed to be printed at a commercial printer and won't look as nice if printed at home. 

You can also find news about recent Eliot events in our newsletters from Spring 2025 and Fall 2024.
