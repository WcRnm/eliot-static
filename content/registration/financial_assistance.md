Eliot Institute Financial Assistance Application Click Here To Download Form

Financial aid is available for those who cannot cover the registration fees for an Eliot camp. You can request funds for up to the full amount of the camp. The majority of our grants are for a portion of the total cost.

The deadline for financial assistance applications is **six weeks prior to the start date of the camp you wish to attend**. You will be notified of the amount of your grant at least one month before camp begins. At that point, if you feel you still cannot afford to attend camp, you may cancel and receive a refund of your deposit.

As a nonprofit organization registered with the IRS, the process to evaluate financial aid applications is open to public review. We need to be sure that we consider applications objectively, and that we are diligent in determining the financial need of each applicant. To maintain privacy and objectivity, the registrar will remove all identifying information from each application before it is submitted to the Registration & Evaluations Committee.

Applicants are eligible for no more than one grant each year.

If your request for financial assistance is denied, you may appeal by submitting a letter and any supporting material to the registrar for review by the Eliot Board of Directors.

Another option for reducing the cost of camp is to serve on staff. Many staff positions include a credit toward camp fees. Learn more.
